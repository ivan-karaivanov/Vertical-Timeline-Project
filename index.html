          <div>
            <time>1999</time> ECMAScript 3 is published, 
            becoming the widely adopted version of JavaScript and forming the basis for most modern web development.

        <li>
          <div>
            <time>2005</time> Jesse James Garrett coins the term "Ajax" (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML),

        <li>
          <div>
            <time>2008</time> ECMAScript 4, a major update, is abandoned due to disagreements among stakeholders. 
            However, this leads to the development of ECMAScript 5. The following year ECMAScript 5 is released, 
            bringing significant improvements, including strict mode and new array methods.

          <div>
            <time>2016 & 2017</time> ECMAScript 7 introduces features like Array.prototype.includes and exponentiation operator.
            Later on in 2017 ECMAScript 8 brings new features like async/await for asynchronous programming and improvements to object literals.

          <div>
            <time>2022</time> JavaScript has come a long way since its inception, evolving to meet the demands 
            of modern web development and becoming one of the most widely used programming languages in the world. Its ongoing development and standardization efforts ensure that it remains a vital tool for web developers.The development of ECMAScript continues with ongoing efforts to enhance the language and add new features. Potential features include record and tuple types.
